General
- Add profiling (timing, writes, reads, etc.)
- Could create main with command line options (much like serial)
- Would probably be good to have base and LE share functions so we don't have duplicates

Random angle
- device needs uniform, host needs normal
- while loop for angle normalization
- if statement for uniform angle (could technically be 1)

Region size
- rewrite region size MxM, N/M regions per side

Locality enhancing version evolve
- For traversing task graph, go one region at a time (go back and forth along diagonals until nothing else to do).
- Allocate buffer for ray regrouping that is maximum possible size of ray group, based on number of primary rays and possible secondaries (buffer size is number of threads times maximum rays per thread (p primaries plus k*p secondaries)
- For regrouping rays, send ray pointer and which destination ray group pointer to go to
- Deactivate rays that exit current region so we don't keep evolving
- Copy buffer back to host
- When regrouping reactivate ray so it can be evolved
- Add reactivate function for 

- After this, add similar buffer for doses
